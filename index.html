      This Magical Garden starts off with a seed class in order to build the flower. The garden is made when the user
      clicks their mouse. A seed is dropped according to the mouse's x position and starts to grow. When it gets
      to the bottom, it enacts the function called expand, which grows the seed to a certain point. After a
      function called growtall is enacted which makes a stem starts to grow to a random height. After it gets
      to its height, the function growcircle creates the center of the flower which grows to a random radius
      size. Then the function growpetals sproats the petals that are portional with the center of the flower.
      Lastly, the petals rotate as if they are being blown in the wind. For an extra feature, the petals rotate
      faster when the mouse is close to them!
